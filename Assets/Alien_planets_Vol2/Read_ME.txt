Thank you for purchasing the pack!

There is 4 demo scenes and a prefab folder for the assets.

The creatures all have 3 skins and an idle animation.

The pack only use two textures/materials (not counting skyboxes and effects).

You can add the bloom component to your camera to match the screenshots/trailers.
